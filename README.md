- 👋 Hi, I’m @jeff-dillon. I used to work as a web developer and have recently gotten back into coding after a long detour into project management.

  
- 👀 I use this GitHub account primarily to house teaching resources I use when mentoring mentoring for [Code Louisville](https://www.codelouisville.org/). As a German Lit major who landed a job building web apps, I like to help aspiring developers with non-traditional SWE backgrounds.

  
- 🏂 I sporadically work on my hobby project: [fauxsnow.org](https://fauxsnow.org/) ([repo](https://github.com/jeff-dillon/fauxsnow.org)).

  
- 📫 By day I work at a software company doing non-technical things. Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffdillon/).
