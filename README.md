- 👋 Hi, I’m @jeff-dillon. I used to work as a web developer and have recently gotten back into coding after a long detour into project management.
- 👀 As a German Lit major who landed a job building web apps, I like to help aspiring developers with non-traditional SWE backgrounds by mentoring for [Code Louisville](https://www.codelouisville.org/).
- 🌱 I’m currently re-learning web development. A lot has changed in the last 15 years. Really enjoying [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) and [Exercism](https://exercism.org/). 
- 🏂 I’m looking to collaborate on my hobby project: [fauxsnow.org](https://fauxsnow.org/) ([repo](https://github.com/jeff-dillon/fauxsnow.org) ).
- 📫 I work at a software company doing non-technical things. Connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jeffdillon/).
